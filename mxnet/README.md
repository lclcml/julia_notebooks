These are example notebooks demonstrating the use of [`MXNET.jl`](https://github.com/dmlc/MXNet.jl)
in [Julia](http://julialang.org/).  They presume a basic knowledge of Julia, including having already installed
the `MXNet.jl` package.

* [Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)](mnistMLP.ipynb): basic use of MXNet.jl to create an MLP (assumes basic knowledge of Julia and neural networks like backprop)
* [ConvNet](mnistLenet.ipynb): use of MXNet to create Convolutional Neural Networks (assumes understanding of previous MLP notebook)
* Recurrent Neural Net (RNN) (to be completed)
